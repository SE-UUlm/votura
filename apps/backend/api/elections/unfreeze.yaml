    Unfreezes the requested election.
    Note that unfreezing an election is a irreversible and destructive action.

    After an election is unfrozen, the configuration of the election can be changed again.
    But all generated voting tokens will be revoked and the election key pair will be revoked.
    Also every vote that was casted will be deleted.
