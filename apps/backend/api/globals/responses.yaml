        Bad Request.
        The server cannot or will not process the request due to an apparent client error (e.g., malformed request syntax, size too large, invalid request message framing, or deceptive request routing).

        Forbidden.
        The request contained valid data and was understood by the server, but the server is refusing action.
        This may be due to the user not having the necessary permissions for a resource or needing an account of some sort, or attempting a prohibited action (e.g. creating a duplicate record where only one is allowed). 
        The request should not be repeated.
        Note, the actual error massage may be different from the example one.
