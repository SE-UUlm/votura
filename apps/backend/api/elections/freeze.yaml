  summary: 'Freeze a specific election'
  description: |
    Freezes the requested election.
    Note that freezing a election is a kind of irreversible action.
    After a election is frozen, the configuration of the election cannot be changed anymore.
    You can not create new voting tokens for your voters.

    After the election is frozen, the key pair for the election will be generated and the election is ready for voting.
    Note that it will take some time until the generated keys are available.

    Your generated voting tokens for your voters are now active and you can distribute them.
