  summary: 'Freeze a specific election'
  description: |
    Freezes the requested election.
    Note that freezing an election is an action that should be done with caution and after a careful review of the election configuration.
    After an election is frozen, the configuration of the election cannot be changed anymore.
    You can not change the number of allowed voters.

    After the election is frozen, the key pair for the election will be generated.
    The access tokens for your voters can be generated after that.
    Note that it will take some time until the generated keys are available.
    After that, you can distribute the generated voting tokens to your voters.
