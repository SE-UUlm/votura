        Bad Request.
        The server cannot or will not process the request due to an apparent client error (e.g., malformed request syntax, size too large, invalid request message framing, or deceptive request routing).
        Note, the actual error massage may be different from the example one.

              message:

    '401':
      description: |
        Unauthorized.
        The request has not been applied because the user does not have valid authentication credentials for the target resource.
        Note, the actual error massage may be different from the example one.

                type: string
                example: Invalid authentication, please check your credentials.
    '403':
      description: |
        Forbidden.
        The request contained valid data and was understood by the server, but the server is refusing action.
        This may be due to the user not having the necessary permissions for a resource or needing an account of some sort, or attempting a prohibited action (e.g. creating a duplicate record where only one is allowed). 
        The request should not be repeated.
        Note, the actual error massage may be different from the example one.
