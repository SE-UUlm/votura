# Changesets

Hello and welcome! This folder has been automatically generated by `@changesets/cli`, a build tool that works
with multi-package repos, or single-package repos to help you version and publish your code. You can
find the full documentation for it [in our repository](https://github.com/changesets/changesets)

We have a quick list of common questions to get you started engaging with this project in
[our documentation](https://github.com/changesets/changesets/blob/main/docs/common-questions.md)

## How to publish

In order to be able to publish you need to authorize your machine to npm itself. This can be done by
running the `npm adduser` command. Without this the publishing process will be aborted.

For each release we will fork from the `main` branch in order to have a fixed set of changes.

Run the following command to add a changeset:

```shell
npx changeset
```

This will open an interactive prompt where you can add a changeset.
Changesets are a way to group changes together and give them a version number.
This will create a new file in the .changeset folder with the changeset.

After that commit your changes to the repository.

Run the following command to release your package:

```shell
npm run local-release
```

This will run the CI process, version the package, and publish it to npm.

It will have created a CHANGELOG.md file in the repository, detailing the changes in this release. This will be updated each time you release.
