    Unfreezes the requested election.
    You can only unfreeze a election if no votes was casted yet, otherwise you will get a 403 error.

    Note that unfreezing a election is a kind of irreversible and destructive action.
    All generated voting tokens will be revoked and the election key pair will be revoked.
